## Card list

## Setup

1. Remove all the Perish and Resurrect cards from the deck.
2. Shuffle the remaining deck and deal 4 cards face down to each player.
3. Deal 1 Resurrect card to each player so that everyone has a hand of 5 cards total. Keep your hand secret
4. Insert enough Perish cards back into the deck so that there is one fewer than the number of people playing. This ensures that everyone eventually perishes except for one person. Remove any extra Perish cards from the game.
5. Insert the extra Resurrect cards back in the deck.
6. Shuffle the deck, and put it face down in the middle of the table. The shuffled deck is now your draw pile.
7. Pick a player to go first, and you're ready to play.

## Overview

You’ll have a deck of cards containing some Perish cards. You play the game by putting the deck face down and taking turns drawing cards until someone draws a Perish card.
When that happens, that person has lost. They are now dead and out of the game. This process continues until there’s only one player left, who wins the game.

## Taking your turn

1. Play a card from your hand by placing it FACE UP on top of the Discard Pile, and following the instructions on the card. Or play no cards at all.
2. After you follow the instructions on a card or play a Pair, you can play more cards. You can play as many cards as you’d like.
3. Finally, end your turn by drawing a card from the Draw Pile into your hand and hoping it’s not a Perish card.
(This is different from most other games in that you END YOUR TURN by drawing a card.)

Play continues clockwise around the table. 

### Cards with no instructions on them

Some cards don’t have any instructions on them. These cards must be collected and played as pairs. If you play matching pairs with no instructions on them, pick another player and steal a random card from their hand.

### Three more things

- You can count the cards left in the Draw Pile.
- You won’t ever run out of cards in the Draw Pile, so there’s never a need to reshuffle.
- There is no maximum or minimum hand size. If you run out of cards in your hand, there’s no special action to take. Keep playing. You’ll draw at least 1 more card on your next turn.

## Card references

### Perish x 4
You must show this card immediately. Unless you have a Resurrect card, you’re dead. Discard all of your cards, including the Perish card.

### Resurrect x 6
If you drew an Perish card, you can play this card instead of dying.
1. Place your Resurrect card in the Discard Pile.
2. Then take the Perish card, and without reordering or viewing the other cards, secretly put it back in the Draw Pile anywhere you’d like.
Want to screw over the player right after you? Put the Perish card right on top of the deck. If you’d like, hold the deck under the table so that no one else can see where you put it. Now the next player goes (unless you must take multiple turns).

### Deny x 5
Stop any action except for a Perish or Resurrect
Imagine that any card (or Pair or Special Combo) beneath a Deny card no longer exists.
You can also play a Deny on another Deny to create a double negative, and so on.
You can play a Deny card at any time before an action has begun, even if it’s not your turn.

### Attack x 4
End your turn(s) without drawing and force the next player to take two turns in a row. The victim of this card takes a turn as normal (play cards, then draw). Then, when their first turn is over, it’s their turn again.
(If the victim of an Attack card also plays an Attack card, their turns are immediately over, and the next player must take two turns.)
If you play an Attack card and someone plays a Deny on top of it, this means that you still have to draw a card and the next player does NOT have to take two turns.
Deny cards neutralize any cards beneath them, so it would be like the Attack card was never played in the first place.

### Skip x 4
Immediately end your turn without drawing a card.
If you play a Skip card as a defense against an Attack card, it only ends one of the two turns. Two Skip cards would end both turns.

### Loot x 4
Force any other player to give you 1 card from their hand. They choose which card to give you.

### Shuffle x 4
Shuffle the Draw Pile without viewing the cards until told to stop. This is useful when you know there’s a Perish card coming.

### Peek x 5
Peek at the top 3 cards from the Draw Pile and put them back in the same order. Don’t show the cards to the other players.

### Combo 4 of each type 
These can be collected as two or three of a kind and used to steal from other players. See below to learn how to steal.

## Stealing

### Two of a kind - blind steal 
To steal a card, play any two of a kind into the discard pile.
For example, if you had two combo cards, you could play them as actions and then choose a player. That player would hold up their cards and you'd take a card at random.

### Three of a kind - "Go fish" 
Playing three of a kind lets you NAME the card you want, and the player of your choice has to give it to you.
If they don't have the card you want, you're out of luck, so be sure to keep an eye on who still has Resurrect cards.

### Five different icons - Steal from the Discard pile 
If you play any 5 cards that have different icons in the corners, go through the Discard Pile to take any single card you’d like.
(Grab the Pile quickly to choose your card so that you don’t get “Denied”)
